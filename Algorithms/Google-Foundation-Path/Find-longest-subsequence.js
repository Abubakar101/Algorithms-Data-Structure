// The Challenge
// Given a string S and a set of words D, find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S.

// Word W is a subsequence of S if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from S to form W, without reordering the remaining characters.

// Note: D can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.

// For example, given the input of S = "abppplee" and D = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"} the correct output would be "apple"

// The words "able" and "ale" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than "apple".
// The word "bale" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.
// The word "kangaroo" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.

// Learning objectives
// This question gives you the chance to practice with algorithms and data structures. Itâ€™s also a good example of why careful analysis for Big-O performance is often worthwhile, as is careful exploration of common and worst-case input conditions.

const D = ['able', 'ale', 'apple', 'bale', 'kangaroo'];
const S = 'abppplee';

function subseq(s, d) {
	let match = true;

	for (let i = 0; i < d.length; i++) {
		for (let j = 0; j < d[i].length; j++) {
			for (let k = 0; k < s.length; k++) {
				if (!d[i][j] || !s[k]) break;

				if (d[i][j] == s[k] && j < d[i].length) {
					console.log(d[i][j], s[k], i, j);
					j++;
				} else if (s.length - 1 === k) {
					match = false;

			}
